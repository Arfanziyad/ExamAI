### ðŸ›  Technical Improvements

#### Frontend Enhancements
- **New Components**:
  - Multi-question form with dynamic add/remove functionality
  - OCR file upload with drag-and-drop support
  - Enhanced loading states with Lucide React icons
  - Responsive question-answer card layout

- **State Management**:
  - Added `QuestionAnswerPair` interface for type safety
  - Separated OCR processing state from evaluation state
  - Enhanced error handling and user feedback

#### Backend Enhancements
- **New API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/ocr/process-question-paper` - OCR processing for question papers
  - `POST /api/question-papers/multiple` - Create tests with multiple questions

- **Enhanced OCR Service**:
  - Improved `classify_question_paper_text()` function
  - Pattern recognition for numbered questions (1., 2., 3., etc.)
  - Keyword-based section detection (Questions, Answers, etc.)
  - Multiple fallback strategies for text classification

- **Database Integration**:
  - Maintains existing `QuestionPaper` structure for backward compatibility
  - Creates individual `Question` and `AnswerScheme` records for each question
  - Proper foreign key relationships and data integrity

### ðŸ”§ Code Quality & Structure

#### File Changes
**Frontend:**
- `src/pages/CreateTest.tsx` - Complete overhaul with OCR and multi-question support
- `src/pages/EvaluatePage.tsx` - Enhanced loading indicators for OCR and evaluation

**Backend:**
- `backend/flask_server.py` - New OCR endpoint and multi-question support
- Enhanced text classification algorithms

#### Backward Compatibility
- âœ… Existing single-question tests continue to work
- âœ… Original API endpoints maintained
- âœ… Database schema unchanged, only extended
- âœ… All existing functionality preserved

### ðŸŽ¨ User Experience Improvements

#### CreateTest Page
1. **OCR Workflow**:
   - Upload question paper image (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF)
   - Visual preview of uploaded image
   - One-click OCR processing with progress indicator
   - Automatic population of question-answer fields
   - Manual review and editing capability

2. **Multiple Questions**:
   - Start with one question, add more as needed
   - Individual marks allocation per question
   - Easy removal of unwanted questions
   - Clear visual separation between questions
   - Responsive layout on all screen sizes

3. **Smart Features**:
   - Toggle between OCR and manual entry modes
   - Auto-classification of OCR results into separate questions
   - Comprehensive validation before submission
   - Clear error messages and success feedback

#### EvaluatePage Enhancements
- **Visual Loading States**: Spinning icons for OCR retry and evaluation operations
- **Clear Progress Indication**: Users can see when operations are in progress
- **Improved Accessibility**: Proper disabled states and ARIA labels

### ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation

#### OCR Processing
- âœ… Supports common image formats
- âœ… Handles various question numbering formats
- âœ… Graceful fallback for unclear text classification
- âœ… Proper error handling for failed OCR processing

#### Multiple Questions
- âœ… Minimum 1 question validation
- âœ… Individual question validation
- âœ… Marks allocation validation (1-100 range)
- âœ… Proper database transaction handling

### ðŸš§ Known Limitations & Future Work

#### Current Limitations
- OCR accuracy depends on image quality and clarity
- Text classification works best with clearly formatted documents
- **Evaluators yet to be updated** to handle multiple questions properly

#### Future Enhancements
- AI-powered question type detection (MCQ, essay, etc.)
- Automatic marks suggestion based on question complexity
- Bulk question import from various formats (Word, PDF, etc.)
- Advanced OCR with handwriting recognition
- Question bank and template system

### ðŸ“Š Performance Impact
- **OCR Processing**: ~3-10 seconds depending on image size and complexity
- **Database**: Minimal impact due to efficient relationship structure
- **Frontend**: Smooth interactions with proper loading states
- **Memory**: Temporary file handling with automatic cleanup

### ðŸ”’ Security Considerations
- File type validation for uploaded images
- Temporary file cleanup after OCR processing
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage
- Input validation and sanitization for all user data

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
1. New dependencies: Enhanced Lucide React icons usage
2. New API endpoints require backend restart
3. Database auto-creates new records, no migration needed

### For Users
1. Existing tests remain unchanged and functional
2. New test creation now supports multiple questions
3. OCR feature is optional - manual entry still available
4. All existing workflows preserved
